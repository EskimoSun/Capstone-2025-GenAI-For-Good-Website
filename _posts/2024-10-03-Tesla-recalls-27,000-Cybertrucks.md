> [(CNN) - Tesla recalls 27,000 Cybertrucks due to a rearview camera issue](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/business/tesla-cybertruck-recall-october-2024/index.html)

Summary:
In October 2024, Tesla issued a recall for approximately 27,000 Cybertrucks due to a rearview camera malfunction that caused delays in the display when shifting into reverse. This defect, affecting models produced between November 13, 2023, and September 14, 2024, led to rearview images taking up to eight seconds to appear, exceeding the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) two-second requirement. Tesla addressed the issue with an over-the-air software update and reported no related accidents or injuries. This recall marked the fifth for the Cybertruck since its late 2023 release, following previous issues with the accelerator pedal, windshield wipers, and exterior trim.

## Normal Prompting Output
```
Frequency Heuristics:
- Repetition Analysis: [2]
    Explanation: The core claim of a Cybertruck recall due to a rearview camera issue is repeated across multiple news sources (CNN, AP, Verge, etc.) and online discussions (Reddit, Quora). This widespread reporting strengthens the likelihood of the claim being factual, making it important to investigate the origins of the information.
- Origin Tracing: [1]
    Explanation: The primary source of the recall information is identified as a filing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a U.S. government agency. This increases the credibility of the report, as NHTSA is a regulatory body responsible for vehicle safety. CNN is also a well known publication.
- Evidence Verification: [3]
    Explanation: The claim is supported by evidence such as the NHTSA filing, which is referenced in the article, and the multiple news reports about the recall. The detail about the rearview display potentially appearing blank for up to 8 seconds is a specific point that requires careful verification. While multiple sources mention the recall, ensuring this specific detail is consistent and verifiable across credible sources is important, as it significantly impacts the severity of the issue.

Misleading Intentions:
- Omission Checks: [1]
    Explanation: While the article mentions a software update as a fix, it omits details about the potential inconvenience to customers (e.g., time required for the update, potential for software glitches), or any potential costs associated with the recall for Tesla beyond the software fix (e.g., reputational damage, administrative costs).
- Exaggeration Analysis: [1]
    Explanation: The statement "increasing the risk of a crash" is a potential exaggeration. While a delayed or non-functional rearview camera could increase the risk, the extent to which it increases the risk is not quantified and may be overstated.
- Target Audience Assessment: [0]
    Explanation: There is no indication that the content is specifically targeting vulnerable or impressionable groups.

Final Truthfulness Score:
    Truthfulness score = 1 - ((2 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (3 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (0 * 1))/6 = 1 - (8/6) = 0.667
Summary: Based on the analysis, the final truthfulness score is 0.667. This suggests the article is "Mostly-True". The core claim about the Cybertruck recall is well-supported, and the origin tracing points to a credible source. However, some areas of concern include possible exaggerations in the "risk of a crash" statement and minor omissions in the full context of the situation.
