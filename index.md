## Introduction
In today‚Äôs digital era, the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant societal challenge. Enabled by the rise of advanced technologies such as large language models and artificial intelligence tools, these phenomena undermine mutual trust and can have serious consequences on democratic processes and public safety. Individuals and entities can now easily create and disseminate unchecked information, reaching vast audiences at an alarming rate. This ease of spreading falsehoods not only threatens social harmony but also necessitates an urgent call for effective detection, evaluation, and mitigation strategies. This paper aims to explore the growing impact of digital misinformation and disinformation, highlighting how emerging technologies facilitate their spread. It will also propose new solutions to enhance the resilience of information ecosystems against the onslaught of digital falsehoods.
